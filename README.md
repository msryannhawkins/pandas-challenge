# pandas-challenge

In this assignment, I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

Given Background:
My objective was to help a school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities by analyzing the district-wide standardized test results. I was given math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task was to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


Breakdown:
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I created a report that includes the following data. It includes a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

For the district summary, I performed the necessary calculations and then created a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame in order to create a district summary and school summary. I was able to identify the highest performing schools as well as the lowest performing schools. I then organized the assessment scores for both math and reading by grade level. After this, school spending was evaluated and used to categorize the data. School size was then considered and utilized when evaluating scores. Lastly, the distinction between charter and district affilaiated schools were used in the datat comparison.
